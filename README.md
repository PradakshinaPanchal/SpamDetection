# SpamDetection

# Spam Detection Project

# Overview

This project is part of my internship with @CodSoft, where I developed a machine learning model to detect spam emails. With the ever-growing need for email security, this model aims to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails to protect users from unwanted content and potential phishing attacks.

# Project Details
The project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify email content. The dataset used for training includes a labeled collection of emails indicating whether each message is spam or ham. The model processes and analyzes these emails, allowing it to classify new emails with similar accuracy.

# Key Features

- Text Preprocessing: Emails are cleaned and prepared for analysis, which includes removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant characters.
- Feature Extraction: Techniques like TF-IDF are used to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for model training.
- Model Training: Various classification algorithms are applied to determine the most effective approach for spam detection.
- Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK (for natural language processing)
